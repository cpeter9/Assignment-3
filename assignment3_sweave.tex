{\bf Assignment 3: Exercise 1}\\

The file Bleed.txt, in RSplidaAlpha\textbackslash RSplida text data, contains
field failure data on failures in aircraft engine bleed systems (each air-
craft has one such system) from a fleet of 2256 military aircraft. Use
these data to compute the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator out to
500 hours of operation. Set this up in a table and do the computation
without the aid of a computer, unless you do your own programming
(e.g., in R or an Excel spreadsheet). Show the table outlining the com-
putations as part of your solution. You can use available software (e.g.
JMP or RSPLIDA) to check your answers.\\
